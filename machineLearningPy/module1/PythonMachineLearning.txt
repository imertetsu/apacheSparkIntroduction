NumPy NumPy which is a math library to work with N-dimensional arrays in Python It enables you to do computation efficiently and effectively. It is better than regular Python because of its amazing capabilities. For example, for working with arrays, dictionaries, functions, datatypes and working with images you need to know NumPy.
SciPy SciPy is a collection of numerical algorithms and domain specific toolboxes, including signal processing, optimization, statistics and much more. SciPy is a good library for scientific and high performance computation.
matplotlib Matplotlib is a very popular plotting package that provides 2D plotting, as well as 3D plotting.
pandas Pandas library is a very high-level Python library that provides high performance easy to use data structures. It has many functions for data importing, manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and timeseries. 
SciKit SciKit Learn is a collection of algorithms and tools for machine learning which is our focus here and which you'll learn to use within this course. As we'll be using SciKit Learn quite a bit in the labs, let me explain more about it and show you why it is so popular among data scientists. SciKit Learn is a free Machine Learning Library for the Python programming language. It has most of the classification, regression and clustering algorithms, and it's designed to work with a Python numerical and scientific libraries: NumPy and SciPy.
